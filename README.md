plus7dumper v0.2
==========

just a brain fuck :p

#USAGE

get from plus7 the link of the wanted video and copy it into the script
e.g.
Enter the Arte plus 7 link
http://www.arte.tv/guide/de/0324342-059/somemovie?autoplay=1

the part ?autoplay=1 is needed if this is not in the given url the script returns an error!

some Links get a redirect if this happens may you will get the error

"Needed link is missing"

!!! be careful if the movie file has the same name as alleady downloaded one it will overwrite the old Version !!!!

this script works well no Linux and on OS X don't use the right color but it will do it job there to....
